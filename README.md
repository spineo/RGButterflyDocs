## The [_RGButterfly_](https://spineo.github.io/RGButterflyDocs/) Paint App Documentation

This experimental free App (currently private) aims to help users find potential acrylic color paint matches associated with selected areas of a photo. It does this by applying a selected _match algorithm_ against a database of reference paints and paint mixes. More about the reference data and methodology can be found [here](About.md).
