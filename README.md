## The [_RGButterfly_](https://spineo.github.io/RGButterflyDocs/) Paint App Documentation

![RGButterfly Logo](images/RGButterfly_Logo.png) This experimental App aims to help users find potential acrylic color paint matches associated with selected areas of a photo. It does this by applying a selected _match algorithm_ against a database of reference paints and paint mixes. More about the reference data and methodology can be found [here](content/About.md).

The three main tasks this App performs are _Reference & Search_, _Image Area(s) Match_ against a reference database, and _Paints Data Capture_.

### Reference & Search

The Initial View allows a user to switch between the five types of displays (shown in the screenshots that follow):
* __Color Associations__: An ordered list of collections each representing a _Mix Association_
* __Match Associations__: An ordered list of collections each representing a _Match Association_
* __Individual Colors__: An ordered list of individual colors (mainly reference and mix paint swatches)
* __Keywords Listing__: An alphabetized list of keywords and their associated reference or paint mixes
* __Subjective Colors__: A list of color categories and their associated reference or paint mixes

For each association (first two screenshots below), scrolling right to left exposes remaining elements of the collection view. Clicking on any of the rows reveals detailed information about the selected association. For the _Individual Colors_ listing (third screenshot), clicking on a row takes you directly to the detailed view for that _mix_ or _reference_ paint.

Rotating to landcape, as shown below, makes it easier to read the full names. In the case of mixes, the longer display names include the two references and mix ratio.

The _Keywords Listing_ (first screenshot below) allows users to search for keywords and associated references and/or mixes. The _Subjective Colors_ listing (second screenshot) exposes colors organized by group. In this view, the elements of one or more groups can be exposed by clicking on the corresponding collapse/uncollapse up/down arrow widget (as shown below) or, alternatively, all groups can be collapsed/uncollapsed clicking on the top arrow widget on the Navigation Toolbar.

![Keyw and Subj Views](images/Keyw_and_SubjViews.jpg)

All listings, with the exception of _Subjective Colors_ are alphabetized and include the top-right hourglass __Search__ (search rules vary with each listing). In addition, the _Individual Colors_ and _Keywords Listing_ also provide an __Alphabetical Index__ for quicker access.

### Image Area(s) Match

A new photo can be taken or and existing image used for the Image Match.
