## The [_RGButterfly_](https://spineo.github.io/RGButterflyDocs/) Paint App Documentation

![RGButterfly Logo](images/RGButterfly_Logo.png) This experimental App aims to help users find potential acrylic color paint matches associated with selected areas of a photo. It does this by applying a selected _match algorithm_ against a database of reference paints and paint mixes. More about the reference data and methodology can be found [here](content/About.md).

The three main tasks this App performs are _Reference & Search_, _Image Area(s) Match_ against a reference database, and _Paints Data Capture_.

### Reference & Search

The Initial View allows a user to switch between the five types of displays:
* __Color Associations__: An ordered list of collections each representing a _Mix Association_
* __Match Associations__: An ordered list of collections each representing a _Match Association_
* __Individual Colors__: An ordered list of individual colors (mainly reference and mix paint swatches)
* __Keywords Listing__: An alphabetized list of keywords and their associated reference or paint mixes
* __Subjective Colors__: A list of color categories and their associated reference or paint mixes

### Image Area(s) Match

A new photo can be taken or and existing image used for the Image Match.
