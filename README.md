## The [_RGButterfly_](https://spineo.github.io/RGButterflyDocs/) Paint App Documentation

![RGButterfly Logo](images/RGButterfly_Logo.png) This experimental App aims to help users find potential acrylic color paint matches associated with selected areas of a photo. It does this by applying a selected _match algorithm_ against a database of reference paints and paint mixes. More about the reference data and methodology can be found [here](content/About.md).

The three main tasks this App performs are Image Match against the reference database, Data Capture, and Search & Reference.

### Image Match

A new photo can be taken or existing image used for the Image Match.
