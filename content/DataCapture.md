## Data Capture Session

![RGButterfly Logo](../images/RGButterfly_Logo.png) The next few sets of screenshots describe the manual data capture process in more detail using the App. As shown in the figure below (left screenshot), the user selects or takes a photo of the desired paint swatches. Since this is a data capture we will change the Action Type to _Associations_ and tap each paint swatch associated with our mix (screenshots 2 & 3). Note that we did not tap on the swatch that is at the bottom right of the quadrant even though it is part of this association. That is because that reference color (Pthalo Blue) already exists in our database and will be integrated referentially. Likewise, the second reference color (Cadmium Yellow Medium), which is not shown, will also be integrated referentially.

Clicking on the _View_ (bottom toolbar, right hand side) will display the selected colors in a table with their assigned generic name.
