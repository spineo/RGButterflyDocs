## Disclaimer
 
[![RGButterfly Logo](images/RGButterfly_Logo.png)](https://spineo.github.io/RGButterflyDocs/) This App attempts to find matching color references associated with user selected areas in a photo. It does this by applying algorithm(s) based on the RGB and/or HSB color properties.  In many cases the heuristic misses the mark or is unable to find a suitable match against the database. My hope is to continue to improve that match accuracy with future releases as a result of both refinements in the algorithms and new paint references/mixes added to the database.

The results produced by this App are just guideliness that might be useful to an artist (especially a beginner). While I have attempted to capture, as carefully and consistently as possible, the reference paints and mix colors, inaccuracies and inconsistencies resulting from the paint mixing process and photographic lighting inconsistencies exist (see also the 'About' section __[here](About.md)__ for more information).

While most references are based on the _Liquitex_ brand this does not mean that I explicitly endorse that brand (it just happens to be the brand that I use the most). Furthermore, no external entity has financed the development of this App. Captured colors or mixes linked to any brand may not accurately represent the intended colors due to shortcomings in the paints capture which includes photographic methods.

For the most part, the App integrates heavy-body Acrylics (see photo below) since that is the type of media I am more familiar with but I am considering expanding to other media.

Finally, this App is something that I have worked on during my spare time and grew out of my passion for Software Engineering and Art (some of my paintings can be found [here](https://deqi4muztfq55.cloudfront.net/paintings--drawings.html)). Since I am not a professional artist, photographer, or expert in color theory I had to research and implement, often through trial and error, the methods and algorithms used for this App. My hope is that this is just the first "experimental" version of a work in progress.
