![RGButterfly Logo](images/RGButterfly_Logo.png) This App attempts to find matching paint references and/or mixes associated with user selected areas in a photo. It does this by applying algorithm(s) based on the RGB and/or HSB color properties.  In many cases the heuristic misses the mark or is unable to find a suitable match against the database. My hope is to continue to improve that match accuracy with future releases as a result of both refinements in the algorithm and new paint references/mixes added to the database.

The results produced by this App are just guideliness that might be useful to the novice artist. While I have attempted to capture, as carefully as possible, the real colors of the reference paints and mixes, inaccuracies resulting from the paint mixing process and/or photographic lighting are likely to exist (see also 'The Reference Data' section __[here](About.md)__).

While most references are based on the Liquitex brand (a few of my paints shown in photo below) this does not mean that I endorse that brand. Furthermore, no external entity has financed the development of this App. Reference colors or mixes linked to any brand may not accurately represent that brand due to potential shortcomings in the data capture methodologies.

Finally, this App is something that I have work on during my spare time and grew out of my passion for art and software engineering. Since I am not a professional artist, photographer, or expert in color theory I had to first research and then implement (much through trial and error) the methods and algorithms used for this App. My hope is that this is just the first version of a work in progress.
