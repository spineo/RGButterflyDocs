## Disclaimer
 
[![RGButterfly Logo](images/RGButterfly_Logo.png)](https://spineo.github.io/RGButterflyDocs/) This App attempts to find matching paint references and/or mixes associated with user selected areas in a photo. It does this by applying algorithm(s) based on the RGB and/or HSB color properties.  In many cases the heuristic misses the mark or is unable to find a suitable match against the database. My hope is to continue to improve that match accuracy with future releases as a result of both refinements in the algorithms and new paint references/mixes added to the database.

The results produced by this App are just guideliness that might be useful to an artist (especially a beginner). While I have attempted to capture, as carefully and consistently as possible, the actual colors of the reference paints and mixes, inaccuracies and inconsistencies resulting from the paint mixing process and photographic lighting sexist (see also 'The Reference Data' section __[here](About.md)__ for more information).

While most references are based on the _Liquitex_ brand this does not mean that I endorse that brand (it just happens to be the brand I use the most). Furthermore, no external entity has financed the development of this App. Reference colors or mixes linked to any brand may not necessarily represent that brand as intended due to potential shortcomings in the data capture methodologies.

The App mostly integrates heavy-body Acrylics (see photo below) since that is the type of media I am more familiar with but I am open to expanding to other media.

Finally, this App is something that I have worked on during my spare time and grew out of my passion for Software Engineering and Art (some of my paintings can be found [here](https://deqi4muztfq55.cloudfront.net/paintings--drawings.html)). Since I am not a professional artist, photographer, or expert in color theory I had to research and implement, often through trial and error, the methods and algorithms used for this App. My hope is that this is just the first "experimental" version of a work in progress.
