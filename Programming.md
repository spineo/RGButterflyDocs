## Programming Considerations

### Language

Work started on this application back in 2014, shortly after I got into IOS development. Though Apple was just switching to  the _Swift_ programming language, I decided to continue implementing in _Objective-C_ as at the time, Swift was still relatively untested and provided fewer online resources. Apple was also expected to continue support for Objective-C into the forseeable future and, more importantly, Swift design allowed its libraries to be easily integrated into Objective-C applications making the transition easier (something I have started doing recently and intend to continue doing for future applications)
